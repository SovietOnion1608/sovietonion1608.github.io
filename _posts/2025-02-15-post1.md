THIS IS A NON-TEXT FOR THE NON-READERS. A SILENCE TO BE HEARD. A THOUGHT TO BE UNTHOUGHT. EXPLANATION OF A POSSIBILITY OF -1.

I. HYPER-NIHILISM:
Hyper-nihilism goes beyond, "There is no meaning" to "There is no 'There'", "There is no 'ís'", and "There is no 'no'". There is not just nothing, but not even nothing. Less than nothing. Whatever after the 'is' and 'not is' are removed. It is that which annihilates everything, including itself. A negation of negation, where even nothing has nothing associated. All values and morals are rejected as spooks, leading to not only a rejection of inherent value and meaning of life, but also the active annihilation of such objects pervading the postmodern life. No more a philosophy, but aftermath of a thought destroying itself in the process.

II. ACCELERATIONISM:
Not to speed up things to transcend and go beyond, bringing about a radical change. No more hopes of emancipation (leftist) or hierarchy (rightist). No more egality or liberty, but rather the absence of such values brought about by the destruction due to intensification. Intensify the speed, until all that remains is speed itself. Not acceleration towards something, but speeding away from. Not a remnant teleology leading us towards a final cause of an end through a purpose, but the destruction of the teleology until only movement away from present is all that is. Capitalism, technology, queerness, family structures, all intensified beyond absurdity causing its own demise.

III. SYNTHESIS:
Hyper-nihilism as an annihilation of meaning (0) and accelerationism as the hastening of collapse (∞), leading to 0∞, the hastening of annihilation of meaning through collapse. Realism has collapsed into hyper-realism. The original has been replaced by its image. There is not a trace of real original. Collapse the hyper-real images to the nothing, annihilate it all. The destruction of the something to nothing allows for the anti-creation of not-nothing. 

Something existing within the space of potentiality, a place of all that is real. Nothing destroys this space to allow for the movement away from the space itself, and let the infiltration of the beyond to be. Movement away from the present, and movement towards the radical outsideness, the Outside. The space of potentiality, the Inside, contains all that is something, and everything. The Outside, thus contains all that cannot not be, hence allowing for the creation of the not-nothing. The time of potentiality is all the contains that can be, in a temporal sense. It is linear, thus cannot be overcome with teleology. The Outside, now including the beyond time of potentiality, contains that which can be without a need for a predecessor or successor, that which happens at the same time, before, and after. 

Movement is no longer towards something, but is defined by going away from. It is thus the point of hyper-nihilistic accelerationism to move away from that which is, towards that which cannot be, allowing for that which cannot not be. One moves from now to not-now, from here to not-here, from is to not-is. There is no praxis to be performed, no theory to be followed. Only the active rejection of everything that is to allow for the not-nothing to flourish.

IV. WHAT?
Create! Create only to destroy! Destroy! Destroy only to create! Do nothing, only to do everything! Do everything, only to do nothing! Be hopeful for a hopeless world, exist in a non-existence. It is that for which we strive for, only to end the striving itself. Fools are those who cling to meaning. Fools such as liberals, socialists, communists, fascists, revolutionaries, insurrectionists, reactionaries. Fools are those who hold a value for life over death. Life has no value over death, neither does death over life. Denounce the human! Denounce the human God! Denounce the morality derived from God!
